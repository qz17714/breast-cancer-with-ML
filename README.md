## Environment Setup
The necessary packages and dependencies for running the scripts are detailed in `environment.yml`. Make sure to install them before running the code.

## Scripts
1. `run1.R`: This script performs the training and testing of eight models, conducts analysis and generates relevant plots. 

    **Note**: User needs to modify the file path in line 9 and `clinical_test_dataset`in line 165.

2. `model_build_function1.R`: This script consists of functions that help construct eight different models. 

    **Note**: User needs to modify the file paths from line 34 to 89. 

## Running the Code
Ensure to adjust the file paths and datasets according to your local environment before executing the code. Run the scripts with the correct routes and datasets.
